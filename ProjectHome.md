# Abstract #

MiLi is a collection of useful C++ libraries, composed only by headers.
No installation, no makefile, no complications: just KISS. Simple solutions for simple problems.

# Donations #
MiLi is maintained at FuDePAN, an NGO/NPO for bioinformatics research. If you find MiLi useful, please consider to donate so we can keep up the research and maintenance.

# Usage #

Just #include "mili.h". You can disable then inclusion of individual libraries by adding a specific #define (refer to README), or just include specific headers ([note](IncludingSpecificHeaders.md)).
Additionally, you may enclose all the libraries within the `mili` namespace by #defining `MILI_NAMESPACE` before including "mili.h".
